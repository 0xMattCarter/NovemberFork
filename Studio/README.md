- The Studio is still in development and will be opening soon,
- Anyone who visits NovemberFork will be able to enter it,
- The final version will allow users to record videos and/or capture images of their creations,
- Using the blockchain and a decentralized voting protocol, these submitted images/videos will be voted on by the community,
- Winning pieces will be made into ERC-721 tokens by us and airdropped to their creators, 
- It will be up to these winners to decide if they want to keep their trophies or sell them on the market,

- In the future we plan to release an ERC-20 token to reward winners even more (yes that's right, a NovemberCoin is on the roadmap)

- See the ControlsX.txt files to learn the studio's commands
